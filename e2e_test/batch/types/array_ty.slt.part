# Comments from Xiangjin:
# In RisingWave, assume arr is of type T[][][]:
#
#    arr[x] is of type T[][]
#    arr[x][y] is interpreted as (arr[x])[y], and of type T[]
#    arr[x0:x1] is of type T[][][]
#    arr[x0:x1][y0:y1] is interpreted as (arr[x0:x1])[y0:y1], and of type T[][][]
#    arr[x0:x1][y] is interpreted as (arr[x0:x1])[y], and of type T[][]
#
# In PostgreSQL, a 3d array arr would still have type T[]:
#
#    arr[x] or arr[x][y] is of type T but value null due to insufficient number of indices
#    arr[x][y][z] is of type T
#    arr[x0:x1][y0:y1][z0:z1] is of type T[] and 3d
#    arr[x0:x1] is interpreted as arr[x0:x1][:][:], and of type T[] 3d
#    arr[x0:x1][y] is interpreted as arr[x0:x1][1:y][:], and of type T[] 3d
